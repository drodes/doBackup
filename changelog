    * doBackup: 
      added feature --> backup_status
          there is a status file created in every backup. 
          this file is checked before doing a new backup. 
          if previous backup was not completed succesfully, it is deleted.
          the goal is avoid an incomplete backup.
      added feature --> show_backup
          when backup start, show a pop-up window in the desktop.
          when it ends closes the pop-up window.
