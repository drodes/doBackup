Goal      : Makes directory backups, for example your home directory, compressed with tar.bz2
Operation : At the beginning of each month makes a full backup and every day of the month makes an incremental backup.
            The scrip verifies if exist the full backup of this month. 
            If there isn't, makes the full backup, but if there is, makes an incremental backup since the last. 
            Also create log files with a list of the content of backup files.
            There is a exclusion file where you can establish all you will not want to copy. 
Requires  : 'config_doBackup' is a text file with 2 or 3 lines
            Fist line must contain the 'source backup folder'. Example: /home/user
            Second line must contain the 'target backup folder'. Example: /smb/bck/user
            Third line can contain the 'exclusion file' or nothing (is optional).
Files out : The monthly full backup name is 'year-month-0-hostname-full.tar.bz2'
            The monthly full backup log is  'year-month-0-hostname.log'
            The incremental backup name is  'year-month-day-hostname-inc.tar.bz2'
            The incremental backup log is   'year-month-day-hostname.log'
            There is a monthly .snap file that maintains the list of files to be 
            copied to the incremental backups
Automation: To automate the backup, run this script from /etc/rc.local (as root) or ~/.bashrc (as user) to make the backup when the computer is power on. Or put in the crontab
Usage     : ./doBackup &
