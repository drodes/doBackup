Goal      : Makes directory backups, for example your home directory, compressed with tar.bz2
Operation : At the beginning of each month makes a full backup and every day of the month makes an incremental backup.
            The scrip verifies if exist the full backup of this month. 
            If there isn't, makes the full backup, but if there is, makes an incremental backup since the last. 
            Also create log files with a list of the content of backup files.
            There is a exclusion file where you can establish all you will not want to copy. 
Files     : The full backup name is        'year-month-00-hostname-full.tar.bz2'
            The incremental backup name is 'year-month-day-hostname-inc.tar.bz2'
            The logs files has the same name but ending with .log instead of .tar.gz2
            There is a .snap file that maintains the list of files to be copied to the incremental backups
Automation: To automate the backup, run this script from /etc/rc.local (as root) or ~/.bashrc (as user) to make the backup when the computer is power on
Usage     : ./doBackup &
