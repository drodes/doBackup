Goal      : Makes directory backups, for example your home directory,
            compressed with tar.bz2
Operation : Usually it makes a incremental backup but you can configure the months of the
            year in which a complete backup must be made.
            Every month the script verifies if a a full-backup must be made. If so and not
            exist yet, it do makes the full backup. If the full backup of the month already
            exist, it performs an incremental backup since the last backup done.
            Each backup also create a log file with a list of the content of the backup. 
            You can use the 'grep' command to seek files keeped in the backups.
            Although you execute the script several blows at the same day, it only does one
            backup every day.
            You can create a exclusion file where you can establish all the files that you
            will not want to copy.
            You can config the persistence period of the backups. Backups beyond this
            period will be deleted.
Requires  : 'doBackup_config' is a text file with 5 lines
            The fist line must contain the 'source backup folder'.
            Example: /home/user
            The second line must contain the 'target backup folder'.
            Example: /smb/bck/user
            The third line contains the 'exclusion file' (or a blank line), is optional. If you 
            do not want use the 'exclusion file' you must leave a blank line
            The fourth line contains the 'persistence period' (or a blank line) expressed in days. 
            Is optional but if is a blank line, the default is: 120.
            The fifth line contains the number of months of the year, separated by blank, in which 
            a complete backup must be made (or a blank line).
            Is optional but if is null, the default months are: 1 4 7 10
            Example: 1,4,7,10 will make full-backups on january, april, july and october
Files out : The monthly full backup name is 'year-month-0-hostname-full.tar.bz2'
            The monthly full backup log is  'year-month-0-hostname.log'
            The incremental backup name is  'year-month-day-hostname-inc.tar.bz2'
            The incremental backup log is   'year-month-day-hostname.log'
            There is a .snap file that maintains the list of files to be copied to the incremental
            backups
Automation: To automate the backup, run this script from /etc/rc.local (as root) or ~/.bashrc (as user) to make the backup when the computer is power on.
            Or put in the crontab like: @reboot cd /root/backup/ ; /usr/bin/nice -n 19 /usr/bin/ionice -c2 -n7 /bin/bash /root/backup/doBackup 2>/root/backup/backup.err
Usage     : ./doBackup &
