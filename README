            There is a exclusion file where you can establish all you will not want to copy. 
Files     : The full backup name is 'year-month-0-hostname-full.tar.bz2'
            The incremental backup name is 'year-month-day-hostname-inc.tar.bz2'
            The logs files has the same name but ending with .log instead of .tar.gz2
            There is a .snap file that maintains the list of files to be copied to the incremental backups
Automation: To automate the backup, run this script from /etc/rc_local to make the backup when the computer is power on
